This is a flutter successor of an app previously made with native android code.
The native android version fetched a json file and outputted it as a styled list of cards

This flutter alternative shares a similar design however many more features have been added. 
The new features include:
- Theme changing
- A navigation drawer
- A favourites section
- List filtering
- A description page containing a collapsable toolbar, the description and dynamically loaded similar content

And since this is all made in flutter it works on Android and IOS!!!
